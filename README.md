## Description

The challenge this week was to create a work-day scheduler that allows a user to input events for each hour of the work-day.

The following sections 'User Story' and 'Acceptance Criteria' explain more about the requirements of the task.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

The app should:

- Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.

- Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

- Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.

- Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

- Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

- Persist events between refreshes of a page

## Installation

There are no unique installation requirements for this product. The app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Usage

The app has simple functionality.
To start, click into the task column of the timetable and input a task or event using the computer keyboard. When finished typing, click the save button. The task will be saved into local storage and remain on the page even when refreshed. To alter an event click into the task column and either overwrite the original task or add an additional task, then click the save button to update the local storage.

## Credits

This project was coded using my own knowledge and the material provided to us on the course.
I also used the CodeAcademy, JQuery and JavaScript tutorials and cheatsheets to help build the JQuery elements, and used some Q&A's from Stack Overflow for direction - though no code was lifted directly from these sources.
